# PHP-8.1.0-Dev-Exploit
Overview
This script is designed to exploit a vulnerability in web applications using PHP version 8.1.0-dev. It should only be used on systems where you have explicit permission to test and exploit vulnerabilities.

Usage
To use the script, you need to provide the target URL as a command-line argument. Here's an example:

bash
Copy code

python3 exploit.py https://example.com
Replace https://example.com with the actual target URL.

How it Works
The script first checks the PHP version of the target URL. If the version is 8.1.0-dev, it proceeds with the exploit. If not, it continues with the exploit regardless. The exploit involves sending a POST request to the target URL with specific headers and data. This is designed to trigger the vulnerability and execute arbitrary commands on the server. The script uses the requests library to send HTTP requests and the re library to parse the response.

This script is provided for educational and research purposes only. It should only be used on systems where you have explicit permission to test and exploit vulnerabilities. Unauthorized access or exploitation of systems can result in severe legal consequences. Use at your own risk.
