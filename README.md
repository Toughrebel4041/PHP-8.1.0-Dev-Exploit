# [_PHP-8.1.0-Dev-Exploit_](https://student-activity.binus.ac.id/csc/2021/07/backdoor-di-php-8-1-0-dev/)

##### Written By: Raihan Sultan
## Overview:
This script is designed to exploit a vulnerability in web applications using PHP version 8.1.0-dev. It should only be used on systems where you have explicit permission to test and exploit vulnerabilities.
***
## Usage:
To use the script, you need to provide the target URL as a command-line argument. Here's an example:
```
$ python3 ExploitScript.py <Your URL here>
PHP Version 8.1.0-Dev Exploit (Permission Granted)((Can Confirm))(((No?)))
I uh... Checking PHP version . . . 
PHP version is: PHP/8.1.0-dev
Can Confirm this vulnerable.
Just wanna make sure you REALLY got permission for this.
Ight then, Wait, exploit is working (Permission Granted)((I Can confirm))
$ >
```
Replace that _Your URL here_ with your URL, but dont use that sharpy brackets thingy, how do I write it on README AHHHH
***

## How it Works:
The script first checks the PHP version of the target URL. If the version is 8.1.0-dev, it proceeds with the exploit. If not, it continues with the exploit regardless hehehehe. The exploit involves sending a POST request to the target URL with specific headers and data. This is designed to trigger the vulnerability and execute arbitrary commands on the server. The script uses the requests library to send HTTP requests and the re library to parse the response.
